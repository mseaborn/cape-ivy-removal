# Tools for removing cape ivy

* Mini rake: [Corona GT 3070 cultivator tool](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TKJQ/)

   * The 5-tine "cultivator" tool is more useful than the 3-tine hoe,
     because its prongs are in a row and there are more of them.  It
     is also somewhat safer, because its prongs are less sharp than
     those of the 3-tine version.

* Hand scythe: [Zenport K208P](https://smile.amazon.com/Zenport-K208P-Serration-6-5-Inch-Stainless/dp/B0054LXP5W/)

* Plant waste bag:

   * Original version, no longer available: [Gardzen garden waste bag, 65 gallon capacity](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756D5NK2/)

   * Newer version, which seems to be equivalent but I haven't used it yet: [Tespher garden waste bag, 63 gallon capacity](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GCSX34D/)
